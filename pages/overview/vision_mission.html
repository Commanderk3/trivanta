        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>Our vision is to create a self-reliant, healthy, and sustainable society where every individual, including
            those from tribal and marginalized communities, has access to quality education, healthcare, and
            opportunities for growth. We aim to be a driving force for inclusive development, environmental stewardship,
            and social empowerment, ensuring progress in harmony with people and nature.</p>
        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>Trivanta Foundation is dedicated to empowering communities through skill-based education in our computer
            learning centers, door-to-door awareness campaigns on health, social, and developmental issues, and
            accessible medical facilities for tribal communities. We also focus on environmental care through plantation
            and waste management initiatives, while promoting community building and inclusive growth for a better and
            sustainable future.</p>
